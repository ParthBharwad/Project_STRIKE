# Project_STRIKE
This project simulates the mission of a UAV swarm tasked with neutralizing a High-Value Target (HVT) in a challenging environment. The simulation is built on principles of swarm intelligence, allowing the UAVs to behave as a single, cohesive unit while also adapting to threats and obstacles.
